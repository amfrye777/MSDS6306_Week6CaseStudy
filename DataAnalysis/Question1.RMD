```{R Q1}
##Merge the Data
Products_M_Education<-merge(Products,Education,by="CountryCode", all=TRUE)
formattable(head(Products_M_Education))

##How Many Records Did Not Match?
nrow(Products_M_Education[Products_M_Education$Ranking=='' | Products_M_Education$Income.Group=='' | is.na(Products_M_Education$Ranking)==TRUE | is.na(Products_M_Education$Income.Group)==TRUE,])

##How Many Records Do Match?
nrow(Products_M_Education[Products_M_Education$Ranking!='' & Products_M_Education$Income.Group!='' & is.na(Products_M_Education$Ranking)==FALSE & is.na(Products_M_Education$Income.Group)==FALSE,])

##Remove non-Matches from Dataset
Products_M_Education<-Products_M_Education[Products_M_Education$Ranking!='' & Products_M_Education$Income.Group!='' & is.na(Products_M_Education$Ranking)==FALSE & is.na(Products_M_Education$Income.Group)==FALSE,]
```

After Merging the data, we find 22 records which did not match on CountryCode. If we remove the non-matches from the dataset, we are left with 189 records which Merged successfully.
