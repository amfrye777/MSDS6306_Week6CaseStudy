```{R Q3}

attach(Products_M_Education)
P_M_E_AvgIncomeByGroup<-aggregate(Products_M_Education[,c(2,4)],by=list(Income.Group), FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
detach(Products_M_Education)

#Order by USDollars Descending
P_M_E_AvgIncomeByGroup<-plyr::arrange(P_M_E_AvgIncomeByGroup,desc(P_M_E_AvgIncomeByGroup$USDollars))

#Filter results on only groups "High income: OECD" or "High income: nonOECD"
PME_AVG_HI<-P_M_E_AvgIncomeByGroup[P_M_E_AvgIncomeByGroup$Group.1=="High income: OECD"|P_M_E_AvgIncomeByGroup$Group.1=="High income: nonOECD",]
row.names(PME_AVG_HI)<-NULL #reset row.names, so they will not display in formattable output

formattable(PME_AVG_HI)

```

After calculating Mean Ranks and USDollars(in Millions), we find that the High income: OECD Income Group's average ranking is much higher at 32.96667 and average USDollars of $1,483,917.10(Million) compared to a ranking of 91.91304 and average USDollars of $104,349.80(Million).
