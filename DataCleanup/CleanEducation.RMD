Similar to our cleanup in the Product Data, lets search for and remove any NA or Blank values found in CountryCode or Income.Group.

```{R CleanEducationBlanks}
## Find and remove records with blank values for CountryCode or Income.Group
nrow(EducationRaw[EducationRaw$CountryCode=='' | EducationRaw$Income.Group=='',])
Education<-EducationRaw[EducationRaw$CountryCode!='' & EducationRaw$Income.Group!='',]
```
